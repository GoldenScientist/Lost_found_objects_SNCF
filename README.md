# Lost_found_objects_SNCF
You have been called on board to help your colleagues of a French Analytics team on the project with the transport company SNCF
You are to help to collect available data, link it and structure for further analysis and visualisations
You will need to explore the data and do some simple statistics on the data itself to understand its quality(number of records, recency, missing values, etc)
Your data exploration is also to lead to an initial very limited data analysis consisting of basic queries, for example, 
Compare the number of objects and similar, or producing some simple queries, like 
Show top 10 objects lost at XYZ station during a rain or a cold weather
